						<h1>DRIVETRAIN</h1>
						<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                        <p>Engine Integration is responsible for finding a solution to fit the Audi S4's engine into the Conquest body, both physically and electrically. This team must identify and strip the Audi engine of irrelevant subsystems along the CAN bus, and will work with Chassis to develop a new mounting solution so that the Conquest's replacement powertrain can be installed safely and effectively.</p>

						<h1>CHASSIS</h1>
						<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                        <p>Chassis design is responsible for the designing and manufacturing of all the frame members, including all attachment points. Additionally, the team performs tests and analysis to ensure their designs will be able to withstand the forces induced from the car. </p>
						</li>
					
					<li class="tab-content tab-content-3 typography">
						<h1>SUSPENSION</h1>
						<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                        <p>Suspension/Handling is responsible for researching and designing a custom suspension solution for the car. The team optimizes the geometry of the suspension’s pickup points, as well as fabricates and tests individual components for strength and rigidity to ensure the car handles as predictably as possible.

							<h1>BODY/AERO</h1>
							<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                            <p>Body/aero is responsible for restoring the body of the car by removing rust, refreshing the paint job, and designing a livery. The team is also responsible for designing and fabricating an aerodynamics package to improve looks, balance, and handling.</p>

							<h1>COOLING</h1>
							<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                            <p>Cooling, Fuel Delivery and Vacuum lines is in charge of reverse engineering the Audi’s cooling, fuel, and vacuum systems (hence the name). Without any one of these systems, the engine and drivetrain would not function. Thus, they need to be cost effective, lightweight, and most of all, reliable. This team will also work within the custom chassis design to fabricate mounting solutions for all involved components.</p>

							<h1>INTERIOR</h1>
							<h5>Subteam Lead: First Last</h5>
                            <p>Interior and Controls is responsible for designing, sourcing, mounting, and testing all of the user-facing devices on the car, such as the steering wheel, gauge cluster, pedals, and other controls. To do so, the team must work with nearly every other subteam to ensure our controls are compatible with their work. In addition, the team is responsible for the fit and finish of the interior, which is vital for our concours score.</p>
